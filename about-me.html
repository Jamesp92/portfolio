 <p>Hi , my name is James Perry but most people call me PJ . i have lived in washington state my enitre life and i absolutley love it here , there are endless out door activities to do and not to mention its BEAUTIFUL! </p>

 <P>I have worked in the food and service indrustry for the last 8 years, In those past 8 years i have acquired many skills such as communication , team work and time management just to name a few . im excited to adapt those skills into my new carreer as a programer .  </P>

 <p>I love to challenge myself which is why i think the programming course is a gret fit for me . I have always been facanated by computer science so i cant wait to see what this course has to offer . </p>

<p> One main reason i decided to take the leap of joining this program is because IM GETTING MARRIED ! so i thought that it was about time for as life style change . Bartending can be fun but it requires alot of long/late nights. </p>
