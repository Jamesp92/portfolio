    <p><u>Hi , my name is <em>James Perry</em> but most people call me PJ . I have lived in Washington state my enitre life and i absolutley love it here , there are endless out door activities to do and not to mention its BEAUTIFUL!</u> </p>
    <P><u>I have worked in the food and service indrustry for the last 8 years, In those past 8 years i have acquired many skills such as communication , team work and time management just to name a few . im excited to adapt those skills into my new carreer as a programer . </u> </P>
    <p>I love to challenge myself which is why i think this programming course is a gret fit for me . I have always been facanated by computer science so i cant wait to see what this course has to offer . </p>
    <p><u> One main reason i decided to take the leap of joining this program is because <span style="color: chartreuse " > IM GETTING MARRIED ! </span> so i thought that it was about time for as life style change . Bartending can be fun but it requires alot of long/late nights.</u></p>
